# Fuzzy C Means Clustering
This project folder contains the code of the various Fuzzy C means algorithm for image grascale image clustering. 

This project is developed in C++ with OpenCV-3. I have used CLon IDE as the development platform. 

As this project folder contains C-Make file, you can build this project from terminal and can run it in any platform (Mac, Ubntu (I have not checked in windows))

Please note that this project is implemented from the Matlab code obtained from this following link : 

                      https://github.com/marearth/fcm_m
                      
I have tried my best to achive the identical result of the implementation done in Matlab. As as example, one image is provided in the project folder. 

You just need to pass the path of the image in the main function and you should get the clusterd image as output. 

I am passing the image path as command line argument but if you prefer then you can directly provide the image path in the code.

The following Fuzzy-C-Means Clustering algos are implemented here :
1) FCM_S1
2) FCM_S2
3) FCM_M1
4) FLICM
5) FGFCM
6) FGFCM_S1
7) FGFCM_S2
8) EnFCM
